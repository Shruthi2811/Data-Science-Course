# Airline-Delays
The past decade has seen air travel become one of the most preferred mode of transport over long distances. Apart from passenger carriers, air shipping also facilitates transportation of perishables and premium express deliveries. This unprecedented growth over time coupled with other factors has led to increased traffics at airports and disturbed schedules of flights. In this project, I analyze the departure and arrival delay trends in passenger carriers, over a series of years. We have inspected the various reasons behind Flight Cancellations. Analysis of crowd at various airports have been performed determining the busiest airports. Also, performance of various Airlines have been examined to provide the carriers with worst and best performance.
